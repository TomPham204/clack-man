# 3D models

Place a mechanical keyboard switch model here to use it in the viewer:

- **Filename:** `switch.glb` (or `switch.gltf`)
- **Free model:** [Cherry MX Switches on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cherry-mx-switches-71e8e1687abc4a8fbef195ab09581287) by BlackCube (CC Attribution). Download, pick a resolution (middle row recommended), and save as `switch.glb` in this folder.

If no model is present, the app shows a procedural switch shape.
